## agnostic_swaps
universal privacy focused alternative to crypto currency atomic swap technology 

## description
- Agnostic fully decentralized crypto/token exchange
- No central point
- No limits
- Agnostic zero dependency zero knowledge privacy focused atomic swaps to exchange any N to any M coins or tokens
- Only endpoints knows what been exchanged if success, else secrets are revealed to revert swap

## explained for humans
- A insert collateral.
- B insert collateral.
- A + B encrypt rules or just sha and push swap rules onchain.
- A and B points collateral to onchain swap rules for activation.
- Process all what been promised or rules will be revealed and collateral gone in favor of good entity.

## advanced privacy
 - any 1 to 1 crypto swap if at least one of chains is not privacy focused is traceable by analysis. For example BTC to LTC swap could be traced by searching for transactions where (BTC * price at tx time) == (LTC * price at tx time)
 - agnostic swaps provide ability to swap N to M crypto, which means, Someone one or both counterparties could receive or send multiple coins. For example Alice swaps (BTC+LTC) for (DOGE+DASH+PIVX+BLOCK). Even little PIVX amount included in swap contract would make transaction practically untraceable.

## implementation
- Blocknet-next.
